<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The workshop of Barsanti &ndash; one of few family enterprises in Italy which have survived the globalisation. Probably also, because they always placed on the traditional, ancient working processes &ndash; marble, wood, mosaic, bronze. Today we are importing from China for little money technically perfect statues &ndash; you need taste and knowledge ( and soul) to understand the deep difference between them and the sculptures made by real masters.</p>

<p>&nbsp;They do provide here mosaic for churches around&nbsp; the world &ndash; stone by stone is adapted handmade, tones are selected, these are originals in the true sense of the word. With the Bronze &nbsp;one feels like in the Middle Ages, just fantastically. And then the works from the really divine stone &ndash; marble. The masters are dusted like with powdered sugar, everybody chisels and mills in his object &ndash; whether this should become an urban statue, or a husband wants to perpetuate his woman in the stone with the help of &nbsp;a photo &ndash; here is everything possible.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The workshop of Barsanti was founded in 1882 namely by Martino Barsanti in the small tuscan small town - Pietrasanta &ndash; here is still the villa Barsanti , built on the beginning of 20 century with many marble sculptures &nbsp;connect them with main entrances and balustrades &ndash; which are still increased by a very special sea view.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Today the workshop works in 5th generation under the care of Gino Barsanti, he studied art, sign and marble works on the oldest school in Italy, his son and heir Emmanuele (studied business management ) &nbsp;deals with the strategical development of the society and their jump on the foreign markets. The workshop is not far from the known marble quarries from which everlasting &quot;Carrara bianco&quot; is covered and on which already Michelangelo swore when he has selected personally a stone block for his David exactly here. One said the soul of the universe.</p>

<p>Gino Barsanti &nbsp;-says the nicest history is, that in the last century some of the people who have learnt with us in the workshop have become big enterprisers and some of it even our competition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tuscany &ndash; the cradle of the rebirth, the inexhaustible spring of the inspiration for the modern masters. Would you like visit the workshop? Appeal to us.</p>

<p><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong>&nbsp;is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&#39;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

<hr />
<h2>Why do we use it?</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using &#39;Content here, content here&#39;, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for &#39;lorem ipsum&#39; will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Where does it come from?</h2>

<div style="background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of &quot;de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum&quot; (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, &quot;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..&quot;, comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</div>

<p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from &quot;de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum&quot; by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>

<p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don&#39;t look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn&#39;t anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.</p>

A real &quot;absolute genius&quot;.</p>

<p>He began his career as an artist as an apprentice in Florence, in the workshop of the great painter Verrocchio and his creative genius and his insatiable curiosity soon led him to be admired and respected by princes and powerful men. He was at the service of Ludovico il Moro in Milan and Giuliano de Medici at the Vatican, as well as a guest of the French king, Francesco I, in Amboise, where Leonardo died on May 2, 1519. This year we commemorate the 500th anniversary of his death. For the important event, the &quot;Committee for the Year of Leonardo da Vinci&quot; was set up ad hoc, called to evaluate the rich calendar of events, with dozens of exhibitions and events.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The year 2019 is therefore the year of Leonardo and there are many events throughout Italy aimed at remembering and celebrating him. Throughout the peninsula will be held exhibitions and events that will see the Genie absolute protagonist.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We can begin to list the initiatives that will take place starting from Florence, where the year dedicated to Leonardo will be celebrated with numerous events, including the exhibition on Verrocchio at Palazzo Strozzi (9 March-14 July). In the complex of Santa Maria Novella, in the former refectory, will take place the exhibition entitled &quot;Leonardo da Vinci and botany&quot; (13 September-15 December), while in the Sala dei Gigli in Palazzo Vecchio will be held the exhibition &quot;Leonardo and Florence&quot; (25 March-24 June). Then, at the Uffizi, already an exhibition was inaugurated last October: &quot;The Leicester Code of Leonardo da Vinci. The water - microscope of nature&quot;.</p>

<p><br />
Always in Florence, the Galileo Museum hosts the conference entitled: &quot;Leonardo: the universe of the manuscripts&quot; (October 2019) and the exhibition: &quot;The Library of Leonardo&quot; (May - September 2019).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And if the Tuscan city will host many events, even in Vinci - Leonardo&#39;s place par excellence - from 15 April to 15 October 2019 will be held the exhibition &quot;Leonardo da Vinci. At the origins of the Genius&quot;, having as its object the link between Leonardo and his hometown, as well as the influences that the homeland had on his career as an artist and scientist. From the Florence State Archives there will be documents able to reconstruct the period of life in Vinci, including the first known drawing made by Leonardo: the &quot;Landscape&quot;, and some notarial deeds, including the annotation of the birth of Leonardo by his grandfather Antonio da Vinci. Furthermore, on May 17th, Vinci will be one of the milestones of the 1000 Miles car race.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Other events will be held in Anghiari, in the province of Arezzo, including the exhibition &quot;From the work of Leonardo da Vinci to the Uffizi Serie Gioviana&quot;, from 1 September 2019 to 12 January 2020, at the museum dedicated to the homonymous battle. </em><em>In Prato, on the other hand, until next March, the Museo del Tessuto organized the exhibition &quot;Leonardo da Vinci and the fabric: ingenuity in textile machines&quot;.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Leonardo stayed for about twenty years in Milan. Therefore the Lombard city could not celebrate its genius. Not to mention that the models of Leonardo&#39;s machines are permanently displayed at the Museum of Science and Technology, where a path between art and science is presented.<br />
In the program dedicated to Leonardo certainly could not miss events related to the Last Supper, preserved in the refectory of Santa Maria delle Grazie, including the recently concluded exhibition: &quot;Leonardo da Vinci: first ideas for the Last Supper&quot;, in which was also possible to observe the preparatory drawings of one of the most famous works of the Tuscan artist.<br />
<br />
At Castello Sforzesco, from May until January 2020, it will be possible to admire the decorations created by Leonardo and completed in 1498. It will be possible to see the restoration work just completed and the traces of the preparatory drawing, depicting landscape backgrounds.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Always at the Castello Sforzesco, inside the Ducal Chapel, will be hosted from 16 May to 18 August 2019 the exhibition &quot;Leonardo and the Hall of Axis among Nature, Art and Science&quot;.</p>

<p>Instead from 2 May 2019 to 2 January 2020 a multimedia path will lead the audience in the Renaissance Milan of Leonardo, making him relive the city as it appeared at that time.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Four exhibitions will instead take place at the Veneranda Biblioteca Ambrosiana, including &quot;The best of the Atlantic Codex. Leonardo engineer, architect and scientist &quot;, from May to June 2019. The exhibition will show the most representative drawings of the famous manuscript preserved in the library: from famous studies for the flying machine, to engineering, architectural and military studies.</p>

<p>From July to September 2019 there will be a review entitled &quot;The Atlantic Codex drawings of the French period&quot;, with a selection of 23 sheets of the manuscript dating back to Leonardo&#39;s French stay.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the Veneranda Biblioteca Ambrosiana will also open in June the exhibition &quot;Leonardo in France&quot;, with drawings of the French period from the Codex Atlanticus.</p>

<p>While the Crypt of San Sepolcro will host from 1 March to 30 June &quot;Leonardo and Warhol in Milan. The genius experience &quot;, an itinerary through the centuries that unites Leonardo to Pop Art by the American artist Warhol.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At Palazzo Litta, from autumn 2019, we will pay tribute to the figure of the patron Charles d&#39;Amboise, friend and protector of Leonardo, with the exhibition &quot;La corte del gran maestro. Leonardo da Vinci, Charles d&#39;Amboisee the district of Porta Vercellina&quot;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At Palazzo Reale there will be the exhibition entitled &quot;The Dinner of Leonardo for Francesco I: a masterpiece in silk and silver&quot; in which you can admire the precious tapestry that reproduces the fresco of Santa Maria delle Grazie, one of the very first copies of the Last Supper realized in tapestry by Leonardo. Furthermore, between November and December 2019, a conference of studies on the last decade of Leonardo&#39;s life between 1510 and 1519 will be organized at Palazzo Reale.<br />
<br />
But Milan will dedicate to Leonardo not only exhibitions and events. The Piccolo Teatro di Milano will stage the play in the autumn of 2019: The Miracle of Dinner. A second show will be dedicated to the Last Supper.<br />
<br />
In Rome, instead, from March to August, the Scuderie del Quirinale will host the exhibition &ldquo;Leonardo da Vinci. Scientist and inventor&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last but not least, in Turin an important collection of paintings on Leonardo will be presented at Palazzo Cavour until the month of May. Always in Turin, Leonardo&#39;s famous self-portrait will again be shown to the public in the prestigious home of the Royal Museums.</p>";s:25:"blog_short_description_27";s:1:"i";s:13:"blog_title_25";s:8:"Camaiore";s:25:"blog_short_description_25";s:70:"For insider the queen of Versilia, smaller, closer, but very charming.";s:19:"blog_description_25";s:6424:"<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Camaiore is a town of over 30,000 inhabitants, extending from the peaks of the Apuan Alps to the Ligurian Sea, in the heart of Versilia.</p>

<p><br />
The climate that characterizes the town of Camaiore is typical of Versilia, influenced by the action of the sea: mild in winter, not too hot in summer.</p>

<p><br />
The municipal territory includes 24 hamlets and among them the most famous and populated: Lido di Camaiore, a well-known beach resort with sandy beaches.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="result_box1"></a>The history of the city of Camaiore dates back to 190 BC when the Romans, founded Lucca, decided to build <strong>Major Campus</strong>, from which the name Camaiore was derived.<br />
Camaiore has many artistic jewels inside the walls, among which stands the <strong>Collegiate of Santa Maria Assunta</strong>, dating back to the middle of the 13th century, next to a bell tower of 1350, and the large central rosette of the 14th century. Of the same period is the Latin cross structure with double entrance. The dome was built in the 15th century, while in 1536 the church suffered serious damage due to the earthquake. In the 18th century the dome, the apse and the lateral chapels were rebuilt. The baroque style interior is divided into three naves with Romanesque columns. Among the preserved works of art is a sixteenth-century organ; a three-cuttlefish crucifix; a canvas representing the Madonna del Carmine; a marble altar of SS. Annunziata of 1659 and a sixteenth-century palace representing the Last Supper. Other things to see: the <strong>door of San Pietro or Lombricese</strong>, built in the same period of castelian walls, erected in 1374.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="result_box2"></a>Along via IV Novembre, which follow the ancient Francigena route, there is one of the oldest churches in Camaiore, the <strong>Church of San Michele</strong>, present here already in 1180 and rebuilt after being damaged by the bombings of World War II.</p>

<p><br />
Nearby, there is the small <strong>Olive Theater,</strong> which has the same structure as 1700 when it was built. Do not miss the visit to the <strong>church of San Vincenzo Confessore</strong>: built in the 16th century, it is known as the church of pain. The Romanesque <strong>Badia of San Pietro di Camaiore</strong>, preceded by the entrance arch of the ancient monastery already cited in 761. Founded by Benedictine monks, the church is what remains of the ancient monastery, together with the refectory and remains of the cloister, nowadays in private buildings.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="result_box3"></a>The <strong>Pieve di Santo Stefano e Giovanni Battista<em> (</em></strong>church of St. Stephen and John the Baptist) is not far from Camaiore. In Romanesque-Lucchese style, the current building dates back to the 13th century, but probably already existed at the end of the first millennium. Next to the apse stands the bell tower with a double door. Inside there is the baptismal, ancient and valuable Roman marble sarcophagus of the sixth century. In the right side chapel there is a crucifix of the seventeenth century, while on the left of the main altar there is a 15th century triptych depicting the Madonna on the throne with Child.</p>

<p><br />
In the center of Camariore there are many historical buildings that have embellished over the centuries the town. In Piazza San Bernardino, next to the <strong>Torre Campanaria</strong>, there is the <strong>Palazzo del Vicario</strong>, the current headquarters of the Bank of Lucca; in Via XX Settembre there are the <strong>Palazzo Papini</strong>, the seat of Prioria since 1966 and the Town Hall building. In the <strong>Tori Massoni palace</strong>, built from the 16th to the 17th century, with the raised portal with large windows on the two floors, the Archaeological Museum of Camaiore is set up.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the <strong>Archaeological Museum</strong> only the didactic section can be visited, with prehistoric finds coming from the Grotta dell&#39;Onda as stone tools of the Paleolithic, bone and flint tools, fragments of ceramic vases, ornaments in shell. The Etruscan-Ligurian phase is instead represented with the ceramics and reconstructions of burials; the Roman period, with coins and pottery from the villa dell&#39;Aquarella, while the medieval-Renaissance period, with archaeological and ceramic majolica from the underground excavations of the same Palazzo Tori Massoni or in the castles of the territory.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Villa Borbone delle Pianore </strong>is a luxurious historic villa surrounded by a nineteenth-century park of five acres, rich in exotic plants and native species. It consists of three buildings erected in several centuries. In the center there is the oldest part, the eighteenth-century villa of Maria Teresa di Savoia, Duchess of Lucca, formerly a mill, to which a chapel was annexed. The south part, called the palace of Duke Roberto, is in Renaissance style. The northern part is finally in 1964, nowadays used as high school.</p>

<p><br />
The marina of Camaiore is the <strong>Lido di Camaiore</strong>, with over four kilometers of fine sandy beach, one of the first resorts of seaside tourism in Italy in the early 1900s.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Close to Camaiore there are many villages of high-medieval origin, e.g.: <strong>Greppolungo</strong>, with fascinating ruins of a castle of 1200 and rocky window on a panorama from which you can see Camaiore and the sea, and with paths to climb Mount Gabberi. <strong>Lombrici</strong>, with the Church of San Biagio in Romanesque style. <strong>Nocchi</strong>, dating back to the year 800, with villas, mills and olive groves. In the hamlet of Nocchi there is also the seventeenth-century Villa Montecatini Bartolomei. The original structure of the villa dates back to the 14th-15th century. Today it is a hotel. <strong>Pedona</strong>, built on a castle of the year 1099, with view from the basin of Camaiore to the sea. There is also the <strong>Traversata delle Frazioni Camaioresi,</strong> also known as Via Bassa, a path that joins several fractions. The route starts from the village of Santa Lucia and arrives to Fibbiano Montanino, through Monteggiori, La Culla, Greppolungo, Casoli, Metato, Summonti, Peralla, Torcigliano, Gombitelli and Migliano.</p>";s:13:"blog_title_26";s:15:"Easter in Italy";s:25:"blog_short_description_26";s:44:"Significant italian traditional celebration.";s:19:"blog_description_26";s:6898:"<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The end of the period of Lent, which lasts forty days, coincides with Easter day. Palm Sunday is instead the Sunday before Easter and Jesus&#39; triumphant entry on the saddle of a donkey is remembered. Good Friday, on the other hand, is the day when people don&#39;t eat meat and take part in processions and Vie Crucis on the streets of the villages. On Easter Sunday, instead, the Resurrection of Jesus is celebrated. The following day, Easter Monday, is also a holiday and people don&#39;t work. It is the Angel Monday, so called to remember the meeting of the winged messenger with women. This last day was added in modern times in order to lengthen the Easter holidays and spend more time with the family.</p>

<p>Easter Day in Italy is a tradition to spend with the family, when people eat at lunch the lamb, symbol of rebirth. There are many Easter cakes but the most common, with sugar and almonds, is the cake with the shape of a dove, while for children there are chocolate eggs.</p>

<p>But how is Easter celebrated in Italy? Let&#39;s take a short trip through the traditions from the north to the south of the Peninsula.</p>

<p>In the North, and more precisely in Bormio (in the province of Sondrio), the Easter tradition is celebrated with a propitiatory rite for the arrival of spring, during which 5 lambs are blessed.</p>

<p>In the province of Bergamo, instead, to the sound of the bells, the peasants go to embrace the fruit trees, as a wish for a good harvest.</p>

<p>Moving to Cividale del Friuli (in the province of Udine), at Easter people play at the &quot;Truc&quot;, an ancient game where eggs slide in order to make them touch each other. Whoever manages to hit the opponent&#39;s egg wins a coin or a candy.</p>

<p>In Tredozio (in the province of Forl&igrave;), Easter is celebrated with the Sagra and the &ldquo;Palio dell&#39;uovo&rdquo;, with games, battles and parades of allegorical floats.</p>

<p>Going further south, you will find in Florence the &quot;Scoppio del Carro&quot;, an event in which a cart (called &quot;Brindellone&quot;) is transported by oxen from Piazzale del Prato to the Duomo. A rocket, in the shape of a dove, flowing along a wire, &quot;flies&quot; out of the church until it strikes and ignites the cart, thus giving life to colorful fireworks in the city sky. Tradition has it that if the event is perfect it will be a positive year for Florence.</p>

<p>In Urbania (near Pesaro) takes place the game of &quot;Punta e cul&quot;, inspired by ancient rural traditions. On Easter day and in the following days, in the central square of the town and at the Sanctuary of Battaglia, the game takes place in beating one&#39;s own egg against that of the opponent before with the point and then with the bottom: will win who will keep the egg intact.</p>

<p>Continuing the journey of Easter traditions towards the South, we arrive at Central Italy. In Abruzzo, in Sulmona, the rite of medieval origin called &quot;Madonna che escappa&quot; takes place: a procession runs through the streets of the city accompanied by the sound of bells and fireworks.</p>

<p>In Rome the main event is Easter Holy Mass, which is celebrated in the splendid setting of Piazza San Pietro or the suggestive Via Crucis, in which the Pope also participates, which takes place in front of the Colosseum, among pagan architecture and Christian rites.</p>

<p>On the islands of the Gulf of Naples, are organized rites such as the &quot;Corsa dell&#39;Angelo&quot; in Forio, dating back to 1600 and which represents the moment of the encounter between the Madonna and the Risen Jesus.</p>

<p>The Holy Week in Procida, instead, is the procession of the twelve hooded apostles and with a cross and a crown of thorns on their shoulders.</p>

<p>In Apulia we have instead the opportunity to participate in one of the processions organized in the province of Bari. Like in Ruvo where, at the passage of the procession, witness the outbreak of the &quot;Quarantana&quot;: a puppet that has the appearance of an old lady dressed in black, whose explosion symbolizes the victory of life over death.</p>

<p>Also in Galatina, in the province of Lecce, we have the puppet of an old woman who walks through the streets of the city.</p>

<p>Still in Apulia, in Noicattaro, on Holy Thursday, raises a bonfire in front of the church of the Madonna della Lama, and then lights it during the procession. The pyre continues to burn all night, as a sign of devotion.</p>

<p>In Bagnara Calabra, in the province of Reggio Calabria, during the Holy Week, the hooded faithful parade the barefoot through the city to ask for forgiveness.</p>

<p>The popular tradition at Easter celebrations has, in Calabria, also other examples in Spezzano Albanese and in Frascineto, where the &quot;Vallje&quot; is found, with dances and folk songs in Albanian.</p>

<p>In Sicily the Easter celebrations are inspired by ancient traditions, with the participation of all the people who enthusiastically live processions and sacred representations.</p>

<p>In the town of San Fratello, in the province of Messina, the &quot;Feast of the Jews&quot; is celebrated, during which the farmers and shepherds wear traditional costumes, embroidered with floral motifs and pearls.</p>

<p>In the city of Enna you will be able to participate in rituals of Spanish origin, such as the parade of the 24 symbols of the martyrdom of Christ, including the cross, the purse with thirty coins, the crown of thorns and the tools of flagellation.</p>

<p>In Caltanissetta you can instead witness the spectacular &quot;Real Maestranza&quot;, with giant statues made of papier-mache representing the 12 apostles.</p>

<p>In addition to the evocative processions, we also have the historical re-enactments of the passion of Jesus, which see an extraordinary collective participation. Among the most famous we remember the procession of the &quot;Mysteries&quot; of Trapani, with the faithful dressed in long tunics that parade with bare feet. But also the Easter celebrations in Prizzi and Adrano, in the province of Palermo, where the masks of death and demons appear, who, turning this way around the country and playing particular trumpets to celebrate the death of Jesus Christ, disturb the religious procession that , on the contrary, it commemorates it.</p>

<p>In Sassari, in Sardinia, we have the evocative procession of the brotherhoods with the statue of the Virgin. In Alghero the faithful pray before a statue of Christ, with women dressed in mourning.</p>

<p>In Oliena (Nuoro) there is the rite of the Crucifixion, in which men and women go in search of the Risen Christ pausing in all the churches of the country, until Saturday, when the statue of Christ is found again.</p>

Pisa is a wonderful city, a tourist dream of many around the world who can't wait to take the picture "supporting" the famous leaning tower - well, today we're going to see what this city has to offer the most attentive tourists and why not maybe it will make you want to buy a villa in Tuscany with a swimming pool.";s:19:"blog_description_32";s:1648:"<p>Among the houses in Tuscany, Pisa has to offer some of the best for those who can appreciate a city that breathes culture. Let&#39;s start talking about what to visit to enjoy the city, but what the Pisans like that tourists don&#39;t know about?<br />
Pisa - What to see?<br />
Most of the tourists who visit Pisa will do nothing but visit the Leaning Tower and stroll around Piazza dei Miracoli, nothing negative, but the city has much more to offer!<br />
Once removed the whim of the main attractions we can wander around to observe how the locals live the city, savoring an excellent homemade ice cream in the many traditional ice cream parlors, indulging in an aperitif in Piazza delle Vettovaglie, following life in Piazza Garibaldi, only to conclude the evening on the Arno, meeting place and perfect glimpse to observe a magical sunset.<br />
In short, if you only have the patience to discover the city, you will discover a wonderful place full of culture and tradition.<br />
What not everyone knows about Pisa<br />
If you are thinking of buying a villa in Tuscany with a swimming pool it is perhaps good that you know a thing or two about the area - well, first of all you should know that although in the 18th century the city didn&#39;t look as bright as today, in fact it was almost uninhabited and populated by weeds, only with time has it been populated by culture and history.<br />
But it is also true that Leopardi said he saw the most beautiful sunset in Pisa, preferring those of Venice.<br />
<br />
There would still be much to say, but perhaps visiting the city is better!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>";s:25:"blog_short_description_31";s:385:"Very popular with Italian holidaymakers, the vacation delights of Italy's sun-bathed deep south are only now being discovered by the rest of us. Calabria is the heart of the Mezzogiorno (the Italian for 'midday' the phrase refers to the baking sunshine in which the region basks), and you'll know it as the toe of Italy. This is the region that 'kicks' Sicily in the Mediterranean Sea.";s:19:"blog_description_31";s:7661:"<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Calabria could be in another country to its urbane northern neighbours such as Milan, Bologna and Florence. Offering superb value for your euros, a little holiday money in Calabria can go a long way. And with coastline on three sides, curving round to meet the Ionian Sea on the south-eastern coast of Italy, Calabria has mile upon mile of sandy beaches, rocky coves, spectacular headlands ... and space.</p>

<p>Calabria is also a region of remarkable beauty, with a long history dating back to its role at the heart of Magna Graecia (Greater Greece) in Classical antiquity; indeed far earlier than that.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The coastal areas swiftly climb to rugged and rocky mountains. Here you stumble upon hamlets whose origins are lost in antiquity, some inhabited many abandoned, as well as old farmsteads. Remarkably too, there is a burgeoning skiing industry in Calabria. You probably won&#39;t be surprised to learn that the population of Calabria has been steadily falling for generations, as the people flee the harsh, rural life. Over 1m Calabrians have upped sticks for a new life in Australia, Brazil and United States in the last century or two.</p>

<p>And when you do discover a populated village it&#39;s like stepping back ... 50 years, 100 years, or much further. There are hamlets in the Calabrian hills seemingly exclusively populated by old women in traditional black dresses, old men sat for hours outside the bar and children playing in the street. The missing generation of mothers and fathers is in Milan, Florence, Bologna or Rome, an immigrant workforce within Italy, working to send money back home and built their own houses. It brings forcibly home the economic division that exists within Italy, between rich north and poor south. It may be 70 years since Carlo Levi&#39;s seminal memoir Christ Stopped at Eboli exposed the poverty of Italy&#39;s south, but things haven&#39;t changed entirely.</p>

<p>But the Romans are fairly recent visitors ... this is a region with very ancient roots. The oldest inhabitants we can trace are the Bruttians, an Italic tribe (one of the many scattered by the Romans). The Bruttians lived in Calabria around 1000BC. Times were best for the old Calabrians under the Greeks, who laid out an efficient system of agriculture. Greek invaders arrived around 800BC, and mathematician Pythagoras was a native of the town of Crotone.</p>

<p>Things got unpleasant for Calabria under the Romans but much worse was to come. The Visigoths arrived in the fifth century, following the sacking of Rome. Legend has it that Visigoth King Alaric is buried with his treasure in the river Busento near Cosenza.</p>

<p>A wearying wave of invasions then ensued. The Goths, Byzantines, Lombards, Saracens and Normans colonised or simply pillaged Calabria, which became part of the Kingdom of Sicily in the early Middle Ages. Refugees from Albania arrived around the year 1400, bringing their language. During your vacation in Calabria you must visit the Pollino National Park. Lying in northern Calabria and crossing the border into Basilicata, Pollino has 34 villages, chief among them Castrovillari, where medieval Albanian is the local language.</p>

<p>The mix thickens further. In the 1500s, the Inquisitions of the Catholic Church drove Protestants from Piemonte here, in search of sanctuary ... they probably figured that nobody would pursue them into the wilds of Calabria. They were correct in that, and the Franco-Provencal language is still used in the town of Guardia Piemontese, outside Cosenza.</p>

<p>If your ideal holiday in Italy involves exploring untamed mountain ranges, you&#39;ll love Calabria.The Pollino Massif of the north merges south into the Catena Costiera mountains. These in turn drop to the Tyrrhenian Sea. On the eastern (inland) side, the mountain ranges drop to the River Crati valley. The Le Serre Mountains reach down to the toe of Italy, and east of Cosenza lie the Sila Mountains and forests.</p>

<p>From the Sila, the Neto River Neto drains to the eastern Ionian coast. This area is covered by the Calabria National Park, a wetland habitat and home to wildfowl. North are the gorges at Raganello, with sulphur springs used by the ancient Romans and home today to nesting eagles.</p>

<p>Calabria only really moved out of the feudal age with Unification in the late 1800s, and the overthrow of the Bourbon dynasty. It partly explains an exaggerated, though often sullen and grudging, respect for authority. In many ways, Calabrian society (inland at least) is frozen in time, and there is the pervasive problem of organised crime ... though it is most unlikely to impinge on you as a tourist in Calabria.</p>

<p>Calabrian cuisine is similar to that of Campania, with more of the Greek about it. Untypically Italian ingredients may be honey, almonds, figs, aubergine and swordfish. Pork features, as does pasta and strong cheeses such as mature ricotta, provolone and pecorino. Italians generally eschew spices but you&#39;re likely to taste ginger (zenzero) and chilli. Calabria makes sweet white wines such as Greco di Bianco.</p>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<p>But things are changing in Calabria of course, with huge amounts of Government money pouring in since the end of World War II, an attempt to right the evils identified by Carlo Levi, to halt the haemorrhaging of population to the United States and metropolitan Italy, and to establish new anchors for an economy based on subsistence agriculture.</p>

<p>Tourism looks to be the future for Calabria, of course, with holiday resorts growing up on the extensive Tyrrhenian and Ionian coastline. Towns such as Scalea, Tropea, Maratea, Diamante and Praia a Mare make the most of the superb sunny weather, sandy beaches and warm sea.</p>

<p>Now a motorway runs west down the coast of this narrow region, the A3 linking with the A1 up into northern Italy. The road puts you within easy reach of resorts that are fun and lively in the summer, deserted in the winter. On the very toe of Italy, facing Sicily across the Strait of Messina, lies Reggio di Calabria. This is the provincial capital and the largest town in Calabria by a distance. There is a prettily restored seafront and promenade gazing at Messina and Sicily across the Strait. Drive round to the Ionian Coast during your Calabria vacation and the coastline gets more rugged. The villages have a distinct flavour of Greece, with whitewashed walls and a cuisine that owes much to those ancient invaders from across the Ionian Seas. There are many Greek and Roman remains, and untouched beaches shelter beneath precipitous roads clinging to the scrubby mountainside.</p>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<p>There are airports at Reggio di Calabria and Lamezia Terme, though most international flights come in to Palermo on Sicily and Naples. The A3 is the main highway north.</p>

<p>Matera - the sassi, cave dwellings, were inhabited until the 1950s, when a government initiative rehoused the occupants. 15,000 souls were forcibly relocated to modern dwellings. An extraordinary sight, and Matera was a byword for poverty (Christ Stopped at Eboli sees Carlo Levi&#39;s sister horrified by a visit to the town). It&#39;s now a very cultured place and in 1993 was made a World Heritage Site.</p>

<p>Aspromonte - the southernmost tip of Italy&#39;s peninsula, and with spectacular mountain walking and scenery.</p>

<p>Cosenza - one of the few big towns (and it&#39;s not that big) in Calabria. A pretty and charming old quarter, and handy for the nearby Sila mountains, with their walking and winter sports.</p>";s:25:"blog_short_description_33";s:116:"Tuscany is not just green and sea and sea and green. In october is starting a very interesting season for much more.";s:19:"blog_description_33";s:2686:"<p>What do you imagine when you hear &ldquo;winter in Tuscany&rdquo;? &nbsp;&nbsp;The days get shorter and colder, dark coats are to take and the crackling fire place is our best friend. This is one part and certainly not uninteresting. But winter in Tuscany is also something else, Tuscany &ndash; one of the most liveliest region with a strong historical background, religious and artistic culture - offers a dazzling display of cultural events.<br />
&nbsp; Nevertheless, we want and can&acute;t forget the picturesque landscape, stir with unique colors and smells, which can create strong feelings. Especially in this time more and more people do book a weekend of relax in a farmhouse in Tuscany. Especially in the winter time, escape from the work stress is it particularly attractive to see a beautiful country house surrounded by nature perhaps, visible through the steam of the heated swimming pool?<br />
<br />
Tuscany offers tourists in the winter, a real avalanche of proposals for every taste.<br />
<br />
For example, the five Sundays before Mardi Gras are celebrated in San Giovanni Valdarno (Arezzo): it is a revival of an ancient custom &ndash; collect for poor people &ndash; and getting fun by dressed procession with music. Obviously inspired by the Old Town with a &nbsp;multi-course lunch menu with typical local cuisine.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Florence, the capital of the Tuscan cities, as beautiful and nobly deserves- is always attractive to be visited also without any festival &ndash;which is actually for every Tuscan town. Like -&nbsp;Lucca - the mysterious lady - offers for several years &nbsp;extraordinary exhibitions like special theme from da Vinci, modern jewelry and other. In the region of Lucca - in Pietrasanta, there is now an exhibition of a Italian myth - the car, and very close-in Viareggio &ndash; Futurism pictures. Events and Reflections 1918 to 1940.<br />
<br />
Tuscany is also a place for music. Countless concert halls and rooms are open - Here only&nbsp; a couple of them - in Florence in November, &nbsp;Loredana Berte, &nbsp;Eros Ramazzotti, Tosca. And to all of this you can mix some of the culinary extras of Tuscany, it is not really necessary to mention Viareggio for carnival. What you are waiting for? Want you stay really at home? To be honest &ndash; I can&acute;t imagine.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Through the peace of nature and the endless cultural offerings - Winter in Tuscany&nbsp;a season of experiences. Something for you as well?</p>
