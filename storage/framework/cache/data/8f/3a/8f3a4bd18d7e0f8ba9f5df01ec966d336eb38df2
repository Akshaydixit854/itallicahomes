It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.  The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested.

What you need to know about Pisa before visiting it?<br />
Pisa is a wonderful city, a tourist dream of many around the world who can&#39;t wait to take the picture &quot;supporting&quot; the famous leaning tower - well, today we&#39;re going to see what this city has to offer the most attentive tourists and why not maybe it will make you want to buy a villa in Tuscany with a swimming pool.<br />
Among the houses in Tuscany, Pisa has to offer some of the best for those who can appreciate a city that breathes culture. Let&#39;s start talking about what to visit to enjoy the city, but what the Pisans like that tourists don&#39;t know about?<br />
Pisa - What to see?<br />
Most of the tourists who visit Pisa will do nothing but visit the Leaning Tower and stroll around Piazza dei Miracoli, nothing negative, but the city has much more to offer!<br />
Once removed the whim of the main attractions we can wander around to observe how the locals live the city, savoring an excellent homemade ice cream in the many traditional ice cream parlors, indulging in an aperitif in Piazza delle Vettovaglie, following life in Piazza Garibaldi, only to conclude the evening on the Arno, meeting place and perfect glimpse to observe a magical sunset.<br />
In short, if you only have the patience to discover the city, you will discover a wonderful place full of culture and tradition.<br />
What not everyone knows about Pisa<br />
If you are thinking of buying a villa in Tuscany with a swimming pool it is perhaps good that you know a thing or two about the area - well, first of all you should know that although in the 18th century the city didn&#39;t look as bright as today, in fact it was almost uninhabited and populated by weeds, only with time has it been populated by culture and history.<br />
But it is also true that Leopardi said he saw the most beautiful sunset in Pisa, preferring those of Venice.<br />
<br />
There would still be much to say, but perhaps visiting the city is better!</p>

Camaiore has many artistic jewels inside the walls, among which stands the <strong>Collegiate of Santa Maria Assunta</strong>, dating back to the middle of the 13th century, next to a bell tower of 1350, and the large central rosette of the 14th century. Of the same period is the Latin cross structure with double entrance. The dome was built in the 15th century, while in 1536 the church suffered serious damage due to the earthquake. In the 18th century the dome, the apse and the lateral chapels were rebuilt. The baroque style interior is divided into three naves with Romanesque columns. Among the preserved works of art is a sixteenth-century organ; a three-cuttlefish crucifix; a canvas representing the Madonna del Carmine; a marble altar of SS. Annunziata of 1659 and a sixteenth-century palace representing the Last Supper.
