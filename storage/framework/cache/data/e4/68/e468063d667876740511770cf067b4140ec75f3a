It is reminiscent of the top of a ship - the property forms a triangle - at the bottom a garage with stairs that leads up to the terrace, the garage can be locked. Access in the middle via a few stairs - small and cozy garden on the left and right. The house facade still has some old frescoes, more would have to be replaced. Hallway - left dining room, further kitchen with exit to the side terrace - here a shed (laundry room) and access to the garage. On the right in the house is a double living room with a fireplace.
